"These two will provide cover to the World Cup squad and can be drafted into the side by May 23, if required."Abid Ali was preferred to Shan Masood as Pakistan's backup opener after the 31-year-old right-hander scored a century on debut against Australia last month.Experienced all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez was also selected in the World Cup group but subject to passing a fitness test ahead of the tournament."Yesterday we got a boost when he started playing with a tennis ball with his doctor confirming he will be available for selection for the series against England," Inzamam added."Our World Cup opener is on May 31 against the Windies, which is still six weeks away, and we are confident he will be fully fit and ready to display his vast international experience."
