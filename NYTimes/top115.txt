It's nice to be picked, but now the challenge is to make a place in the playing XI and repay the faith shown by the team management."Jayed's selection came at the expense of fellow paceman Taskin Ahmed, who missed the Zealand tour with an ankle injury.Jayed has taken 11 wickets in the five test matches he has played and was impressive in his last match against New Zealand at Wellington, where he took three for 94.Jayed would now need to replicate his test success with the white ball in England."I am playing for the last 10 years and during this time, had the opportunity to play a lot of cricket at different levels. So don't think it will be a big problem," he said."I got appreciated for my ability to swing the ball even by some of the leading batsmen in New Zealand, who believed that if I can work on it I have a good chance of turning into a good bowler. "Recently Mashrafe (captain Mortaza) told me that he is also optimistic about my ability to swing the ball."
