He needs to play in the 'V' the first few balls, irrespective of the format, maybe push the ball towards long-on or long-off frequently and get his eyes in."He has great ability and a range of shots to make it up in the end," added Srikkanth, a member of India's triumphant 1983 World Cup team.Delhi head coach Ricky Ponting also believes Pant needed to be patient to be able to inflict maximum damage on rivals in the final overs."With Rishabh in white-ball cricket, the issue is that he's such a competitor that sometimes that gets the better of him," Ponting said ahead of Friday's match with Kolkata Knight Riders."He wants to get things done quickly in the white-ball game. In the tests he doesn't so much because there's not as much scoring pressure in tests."Ponting, however, would not ask the 21-year-old to change the way he bats."I'm not going to curb the way he plays, I'm not gonna tell him to slow down because if he plays his best he will win games for us," Ponting said.
