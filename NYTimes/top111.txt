"The selection panel has been impressed with Jofra Archer's performances in domestic and franchise cricket. He is a very talented and exciting cricketer," national selector Ed Smith said.England play Ireland in a one-dayer on May 3 before a five-match ODI series and a Twenty20 against Pakistan."In line with ICC (International Cricket Council regulations, we have to name a preliminary squad of 15 for the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup before April 23," Smith added."However, all 17 players named in the ODIs against Pakistan can stake a claim to be in the final 15-man squad, finalised at the end of that series."Fast bowler Chris Jordan, Archer's Sussex team mate, could also make a comeback to the ODI setup against Pakistan, despite playing his last 50-overs game for England in September 2016."Chris Jordan, a regular in IT20 squads over the past few years, has continued to develop as a cricketer -- as we saw in the IT20s in the West Indies. He fully deserves his return to the ODI squad," Smith said. "With regard to resting players, we are conscious of managing player workloads leading into such an important summer so that players are in the best possible condition for the World Cup. That was also a factor in the way we have selected these three squads."
