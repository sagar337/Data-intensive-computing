He hit me for a six and a four which was fine but I got his wicket which was very important for the team, more than personal achievement."He's such a good player, especially in the death overs."While Tahir will play in one last World Cup he has no intention of retiring from the game just yet."I don't want to retire. I love the game, I have respect for the game and passion for the game," he said.
