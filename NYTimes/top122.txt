It's not an overnight fix, but it's important to share ideas with them, so they have something to build on."West Indies head coach Floyd Reifer said it was important to have a "finisher" like Sarwan working with the batsmen."We're hoping he can help the batsmen get a better understanding of how to finish games -- the mindset, how to approach batting first, how to approach batting last," Reifer said."He fitted in very well. He did a lot of talking and a lot of work with the batsmen."West Indies have also added former Pakistan spinner Mushtaq Ahmed and former fast bowlers Corey Collymore and Roddy Estwick to their coaching staff for the two tournaments.
