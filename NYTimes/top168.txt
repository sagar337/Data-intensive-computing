He received a standing ovation.Alderson began his baseball career with the A’s in 1981 and was one of the sport’s pioneers in sabermetrics. Back then, he counseled Beane, his successor, whose reliance on advanced statistics kept the small-market team competitive and was famously documented in the book “Moneyball.”“His mentorship and friendship have been invaluable to me over the course of my career, and I look forward to the expertise and perspective he will add at every level of the organization,” Beane, the A’s executive vice president of baseball operations, said of Alderson in a statement issued by the team.Referring to David Forst, the current A’s general manager, Beane added, “David and I couldn’t be more excited to bring him back to Oakland.”Alderson was the architect of the A’s teams that won three straight American League pennants from 1988 to ’90, as well as the 1989 World Series. He left in 1998.“I am really excited to return to the A’s and the Bay Area,” Alderson said in the team’s statement. “I look forward to being as helpful as I can to Billy, David and the rest of the baseball operations staff.”After his 17-season stint with the Athletics, Alderson spent seven years working in Major League Baseball headquarters and four years as the chief executive of the San Diego Padres, before going back to the M.L.B. commissioner’s office for a year.From October 2010 until June 2018, Alderson served as the Mets’ general manager, guiding them from a period of financial austerity to the 2015 World Series, during which he dealt with his initial cancer diagnosis, and to a 2016 wild-card game.Then came a 92-loss season in 2017, a rough first half in 2018 and the cancer recurrence. Alderson took an indefinite leave of absence, with the expectation that the Mets would find a replacement. The team hired Brodie Van Wagenen as their new general manager in October.In other front-office news, the Mets announced that their longtime assistant general manager, John Ricco, had moved into a newly created position with the title of senior vice president, senior strategy officer. Ricco, 50, joined the Mets in 2004 and served as a right-hand man to four general managers.
