"That would be the death of women's sport."Since coming out in support for tougher rules on testosterone levels, Radcliffe said she has received abuse on social media."A lot of these people that are attacking me wouldn't stand in front of me and say those things to me," Radcliffe added."It's very dangerous because there are vulnerable athletes out there who can't make the distinction between what's reality and what's not and what somebody truthfully stands by and someone just being a troll."
