Nine athletics finals will be held in the morning while Basketball and swimming will also feature medal events in the morning.“By looking at the Olympic schedule as a whole it should be observed that one gave consideration to local, Japanese, as well as global audiences,” Murofushi said. “Also, I hear that athletes are saying it is possible to condition if they know the schedule in advance, so I think that they should condition themselves to do their best at Games time.”Women’s softball will be the first event of the Olympics, in Fukushima on July 22, two days before the Opening Ceremony.The women’s 10 meters air rifle is the first medal event of the Games, starting at 8.30 a.m. on July 25.
