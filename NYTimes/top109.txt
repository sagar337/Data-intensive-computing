But it's the nature of international cricket that there is always someone knocking on the door."England will name a provisional 15-man squad for the World Cup on Wednesday, alongside an expanded group of 17 for limited-overs series against Ireland and Pakistan next month.Even if Archer is not included in the initial squad, England can make changes to it until May 23, seven days before their tournament opener against South Africa at The Oval.Asked if there would be added pressure on Archer if called up, Woakes said: "He might thrive off it or it might have the opposite effect."But from what everyone is hearing he might be part of the Ireland and Pakistan matches so there will be pressure on everyone to perform.
