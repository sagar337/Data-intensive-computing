Some of the things he can do at the click of a finger are just 'wow'. It's pretty special to watch."To have someone at the pace he bowls and the skills he has... the selectors are going to be scratching their heads... it's a great position to be in as an England team when you've got a player with the skill level Jofra's got."Archer and Stokes are team mates at Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League.In February, England coach Trevor Bayliss said a decision over Archer was the "final piece of the jigsaw" in their World Cup plans.
