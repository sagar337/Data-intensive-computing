We need a team that can create consistency."If we can get to the knock-out stages, we can knock out any team. We have seen that in the past. But consistency is going to take us right through to the finals."Former West Indies captain Lara, considered one of the very best the Caribbean islands have ever produced, retired after the 2007 World Cup at home with over 10,000 runs in ODIs. He also scored close to 12,000 runs in tests.Lara credited franchise leagues like the IPL for creating interest among kids in the West Indies and giving young players a platform to showcase their talent before they graduate to international cricket.West Indies suffered 2-0 losses both in India and Bangladesh late last year but staged a spectacular turnaround in a 2-1 series win against England earlier this year.The test success augurs well for the side, who are now graduating to a level where they can be competitive against top sides at least at home, said Lara."We had a tremendous series against England. We are laying the foundation, the confidence is there," Lara added. "India may have to worry when they come there in July to play against the West Indies because they have a team now that understand the conditions, spirits are high, let's see what we can do against India.
