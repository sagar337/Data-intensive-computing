Lab2: DATA AGGREGATION, BIG DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION:

In this lab, we will expand our skills in data exploration developed in Lab1 and enhance them by adding
big data analytics and visualization skills. This document describes Lab2: Data Aggregation, Big Data
Analysis and Visualization, involves (i) data aggregation from more than one source using the APIs
(Application programming interface) exposed by data sources, (ii) Applying classical big data analytic
method of MapReduce to the unstructured data collected, (iii) store the data collected on WORM
infrastructure Hadoop and (iii) building a visualization data product.
We will leverage the data collection and exploratory data analysis skills developed in Lab1 to accomplish
the goals of Lab2.
